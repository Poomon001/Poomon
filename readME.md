# Yearbook-Baby-Gallery
Yearbook Baby Gallery is a dynamic website that is utilized to display and manage photos. It means to give Yearbook's members an easier time to collect and manage photos uploaded by grad students.  

My partner and I had decided to carry on a final programming project before graduating from high school. Our programming teacher, who is a school Yearbook counselor, suggested this project to us, and we decided to do so.

# Yearbook-Baby-Gallery
Yearbook Baby Gallery is a dynamic website that is utilized to display and manage photos. It means to give Yearbook's members easier time to collect and manage childhood photos uploaded by grad students.  

My partner and I had decided to carry on a final programming project before we graduated from highschool. Our programming teacher, who is the school Yearbook conselor, suggested this project to us, and we decided to do so.
